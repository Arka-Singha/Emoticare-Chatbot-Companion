<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Our project, a Mental Health AI Chatbot, focuses on bridging the gap between people and their inability to address their emotions openly. It provides emotional support through real-time sentiment analysis, mood tracking, and adaptive responses.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In the modern world, mental health is a serious issue that is neither treated properly nor given much importance. The main goal of our project is to create a personalized and friendly environment for the user through AI â€” to address their issues, get answers regarding their mental state, empathize with them, and serve as a friendly guide.</p>

<h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
<p>We would like to express our heartfelt gratitude to our supervisor and mentor, Dr. Sricheta Parui. We also extend our thanks to KIIT University for allowing us to present our work.</p>
